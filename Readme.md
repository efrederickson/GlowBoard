GlowBoard
===================
An open source, better, customizable alternative to ActiveBoard.

Other names include:
- HolyBoard
- JesusBoard
- LivingBoard
- ActiveBoard(2,++)
- A U X O 3

Features:
- White glow on running apps (takes precedence over badge glow)
- Red glow on apps with a badge/notification
- Grow animation on badged apps
- Dock bounce on badged apps
- Less CPU and battery usage than ActiveBoard
- A multitude of options

Conflicts with BounceNotify, although implements same features.

TODO:
- More custom colors
- Option for either old outline (using cornerRadius) or glow
- Active (dock) indicator (none, line underneath, dot)
